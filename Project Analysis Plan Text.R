# Null hypothesis: The genotype of clades 126, 215, 222, 305, 313, and 319, of the symbiont, Regiella insecticola, and of the live host, Acyrthosiphon pisum, did not significantly increase the average rate of sporulation per day on cadaver Acyrthrosiphon pisum.
# Alternative hypothesis: The genotype of clades 126, 215, 222, 305, 313, and 319, of the symbiont, Regiella insecticola, and of the live host, Acyrthosiphon pisum, significantly increased the average rate of sporulation per day on cadaver Acyrthrosiphon pisum.

# I will use a two-way ANOVA to test if there is a significant
# relationship between the average rate of sporulation
# per day (the dependent variable) on host cadaver Acyrthosiphon pisum
# (independent variable 1) vs. the average rate of sporulation per day on
# symbiont Regiella insecticola (independent variable 2), measuring how
# genotype of the host and symbiont clades of Acyrthosiphon pisum and
# Regiella insecticola affect the rate of sporulation.

# ANOVA p value greater than or equal to 0.05.

# Results of the ANOVA will be expressed as a multivariable bar graph,
# that is, a graph with one dependent variable (sporulation
# rate per day), plotted against the genotype of the clade number of
# the host (1st variable) and of the symbiont (2nd variable). Genotype
# clade number will be on the x-axis while sporulated rate (number of
# cadaver Acyrthosiphon pisum who sporulated) will be on the y-axis.
# There will be 2 bars per clade number, one representing host genotype
# and one representing symbiont genotype.

# Additionally, I would like to perform
# a multivariable linear regression, if possible, using the same exact parameters
# above, and represent the results in a line graph with two lines
# showing the distinctions between the average rate of sporulation
# per day (dependent variable) on host genotype clade (independent variable
# 1) and of symbiont genotype clade (independent variable 2). Sporulation
# rate per day) will be plotted against the genotype of the clade number of
# the host and of the symbiont. Genotype clade number will be
# on the x-axis while sporulated rate (number of cadaver Acyrthosiphon pisum
# who sporulated) will be on the y-axis. The multivariable linear regression
# will not be performed if the data shows high correlation, does not
# follow a normal distribution, or does not exhbit linearity.

# Regression p value greater than or equal to 0.05.
